In rare cases, it can also cause digestive issues like vomiting, nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and constipation.

                "Understanding your baby\u2019s temperament involves observing their unique character and behaviors, such as their energy levels, reactions to new experiences, and sensitivity to light, noise, and texture. Babies can be categorized as \"easy,\" \"sensitive,\" or \"cautious.\" \"Easy\" babies follow a regular routine and adapt well to changes. \"Sensitive\" babies may cry a lot and need more care and patience, as they don\u2019t easily adapt to new things. \"Cautious\" babies are calm, take time to adjust, and seem more independent. Regardless of their temperament, it\u2019s essential to provide consistent care and engage with your child at their pace, whether that means helping them focus with quiet activities or encouraging their exploration through physical play."
